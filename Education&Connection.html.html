        <center> <h1>""The Education And Connection Updates At the Period Of Covid-19""</h1>
        <p><big><h1>1-At First We Would Talk About Education Updates:</h1>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges.

            Most governments decided to temporarily close educational institutions in an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19.[1][2] As of 12 January 2021, approximately 825 million learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 23 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 40 are implementing local closures, impacting about 47 percent of the world's student population. 112 countries' schools are currently open.[3]
            
            On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS & A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.[4] International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.[5] In addition, Advanced Placement Exams, SAT administrations, and ACT administrations have been moved online or cancelled.
            
            School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families,[6] but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.[7][8][9] School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt,[10] digital learning,[9][11][12] food insecurity,[13] and homelessness,[14][15] as well as access to childcare,[16] health care,[17] housing,[18] internet,[19] and disability services.[20] The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.[21][22]
            
            In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.[23]

    <p><big><h2>2-Then,We Would Talk About Connection Updates:</h2>the implementation of ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0 information technologies to remote communication processes, economic processes and the improvement of analytical processes implemented in various scientific disciplines, many institutions and economic entities have managed to significantly reduce the negative effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to the aforementioned technologies, the scale of the health, economic, social, etc. crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is much smaller than it would be if these technologies did not exist. Therefore, the current fourth technological revolution has proved to be very helpful in reducing the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on the functioning of people, the operation of public institutions, economic entities and entire economies. If this type of pandemic appeared, for example, in the middle of the 20th century, i.e. before the development of computer science and the third technological revolution, then the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on people and entire economies would be several times higher than that recorded in 2020.>
